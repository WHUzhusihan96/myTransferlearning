# record my study here

I will keep some codes during my study here.

Most of these are about Transfer Learning (Domain adaptation).And i just provide the paper URL, you need to download it yourself.

Here is the most important [survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5288526) in Transfer Learning by Yang Qiang. Pan S J, Yang Q. A survey on transfer learning[J]. IEEE Transactions on knowledge and data engineering, 2010, 22(10): 1345-1359.

I'm very thankful for [this transfer learning repo](http://transferlearning.xyz/).
