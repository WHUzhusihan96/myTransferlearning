# GFK

The paper and the code of GFK

The origin code can be seen here [[WJD](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/traditional/GFK)]. If you use python, there's some package should been download.

GFK is the representative method of manifold learning.But I don't quite understand it.
