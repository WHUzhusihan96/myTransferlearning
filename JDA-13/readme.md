The paper and the code of JDA

I write `myJDA.m` by myself and refer to the following work.(`JDA.m` can be seen here [[WJD]](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/traditional/JDA))

There's also having code in python style, and also i write `JDA.ipynb` by myself and refer to the following work.(`JDA.py` can be seen here [[WJD]](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/traditional/JDA))

There's a little different between the code written by myself and WJD in python style. I think i'm right. But the accuracy is a little worse than WJD's .You can select what you think better.`And when you do traditional TL, I suggest matlab`(there's no problem in matlab version)

Many thanks to Wang J.D. for sharing his experience and knowledge.His introduction to JDA [[here]](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27336930)
